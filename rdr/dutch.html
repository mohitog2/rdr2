    <div class="about">
        <p class="information">Dutch van der Linde is the charismatic yet manipulative leader of the Van der Linde gang in *Red Dead Redemption 2*. A
        visionary with grand ideals of freedom and living outside the constraints of civilization, Dutch often justifies his
        criminal acts as a means to create a better life for his gang. Initially, he is portrayed as intelligent and caring, but
        his obsession with control, growing paranoia, and belief in his own righteousness lead to his downfall. Dutch's
        character arc explores themes of betrayal, hubris, and the cost of unchecked ambition, making him one of the most
        compelling figures in the story.
